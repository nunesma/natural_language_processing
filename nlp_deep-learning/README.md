# Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
Objective: It's a Stanford CS224n introduction to cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for Natural language processing (NLP) using PyTorch.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a crucial part of artificial intelligence. 

Applications of NLP: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual agents, medical reports, etc. 

In recent years, Deep Learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering.
