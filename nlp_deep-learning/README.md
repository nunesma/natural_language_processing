# Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

### CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

Stanford's Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning Course. The material offered is the class of 2021.

The objective of CS224n is about the fundamental concepts and ideas in natural language processing (NLP) under a deep learning approach, looking to convey the understanding of both the algorithms available for processing linguistic information as well as the underlying computational properties of natural languages.
